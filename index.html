&body=Dear%20Sir%2FMadam%2C%0A%0A
I%20object%20to%20the%20proposed%20barrier%20at%20Stag%20Meadow%20car%20park.%20
It%20would%20block%20public%20access%20to%20Windsor%20Great%20Park%20and%20worsen%20traffic%20in%20nearby%20streets.%0A%0A
Windsor%20Girls%E2%80%99%20School%20already%20has%20parking%20agreements%20that%20should%20be%20enforced.%0A%0A
This%20land%20is%20used%20by%20the%20public%20and%20should%20remain%20open%20to%20everyone.%0A%0A
Please%20record%20this%20objection.%0A%0A
Sincerely%2C%0A%5BYour%20Name%5D%0A%5BYour%20Postcode%5D">
